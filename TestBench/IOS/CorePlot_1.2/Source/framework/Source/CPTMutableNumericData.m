/** @brief An annotated NSMutableData type.
 *
 *  CPTNumericData combines a mutable data buffer with information
 *  about the data (shape, data type, size, etc.).
 *  The data is assumed to be an array of one or more dimensions
 *  of a single type of numeric data. Each numeric value in the array,
 *  which can be more than one byte in size, is referred to as a @quote{sample}.
 *  The structure of this object is similar to the NumPy <code>ndarray</code>
 *  object.

 *  @brief The shape of the data buffer array. Set a new shape to change the size of the data buffer.
 *
 *  The shape describes the dimensions of the sample array stored in
 *  the data buffer. Each entry in the shape array represents the
 *  size of the corresponding array dimension and should be an unsigned
 *  integer encoded in an instance of NSNumber.
